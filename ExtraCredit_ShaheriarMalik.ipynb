    "# CS171 - Winter 2022 - Extra Credit Assignment: \n",
    "# Unsupervised Analysis of a Movie Ratings Dataset Using Matrix Factorization\n",
    "### Instructor: Vagelis Papalexakis\n",
    "### TA: Yorgos Tsitsikas\n",
    "### Credit: 10/100 points of the final grade\n",
    "\n",
    "In this extra credit assignment we will explore a family of unsupervised learning tools called Matrix Factorization, and apply it a version of the famous MovieLens dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), developed by the University of Minnesota and largely pioneered the field of recommendation systems. For the purposes of this assignment, we will focus on a small version of this dataset which can be downloaded here: http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip (and the associated README: http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small-README.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we are going to form a (movie, user) matrix, which will hold the rating that each user gave to a particular movie. Since we have meta-data for the movies (including title, genre(s), and data), we are going to treat the movies as our primary data points of interest and treat the users as features, and we will explore the space of movies in an unsupervised manner. Typically, however, both movies and users are treated as primary data points in this problem definition, since a platform that offers movies and wants to leverage movie ratings will want to understand both the movies and the users (preferrably in combination).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in class, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is the most popular method in this family, and for good reason, since it can provably approximate a data matrix (e.g., where the rows are the data points and the columns are the features) optimally (when measuring the squared error between the approximation and the original data) in a smaller dimension. The above process is called low rank approximation and is a fundamental approach in dimensionality reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "During low rank approximation, using some sort of matrix factorization (e.g., the SVD), we are forcing the potentially very high-dimensional data points in our dataset (i.e., rows of the matrix) to occupy a much smaller-dimensional space. By doing so, we implicitly assume that even though data points (movies in our case) may \"live\" in a very high-dimensional feature space (in our case, every user is a feature and the rating they gave the movie is the value for that feature, amounting to hundreds of features), in reality each movie \"lives\" in a much smaller space, e.g., the space of genres. Since we are working with movies, we typically have some genre information already available. However, what this low rank approximation can reveal to us is groupings of movies in new \"genres\" which are discovered from the data and reflect the manner in which different users appear to enjoy the movies in that \"genre\" similarly. In that sense, we do not necessarily expect those data-driven \"genres\" to directly map to the pre-determined genre classification of a particular movie, however, it would make a lot of sense if most of them do. We often call those \"genres\" \"latent concepts\" because they are initially hidden in the large dimensionality of the data, but they are uncovered by the low rank approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will use two different matrix factorization techniques:\n",
    "- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): As we saw in class, this is the optimal we can do in terms of squared error. However, there are some drawbacks here, since the SVD can have negative values, especially in cases where latent concepts (\"genres\") overlap, making our life harder when it's time to try to interpret the membership of each movie to latent concept.\n",
    "- Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF): NMF is a constrained matrix factorization, where the factor matrices (representing the mappings of movie to latent concept and user to latent concept) have non-negative values. This is extremely important in cases such as in this assignment, where we need to inspect and interpret the results. The following, highly-influential paper in Nature describes NMF very succinctly: https://www.nature.com/articles/44565"

    "First we have to load the data in a format that we can process. For this, please download http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip\n",
    "There are several .csv files in that folder, but the ones we will focus on for this assignment are 1) 'ratings.csv', which holds the ratings that each user gave each movie, and 2) 'movies.csv', which holds the movie meta-data that will be useful to us so that we judge the quality of the discovered \"genres\".\n",

    "Make sure you can load those two files and familiarize yourself with the format of each of the files. You may use functionality from Pandas (e.g., DataFrame) as in the previous assignments.\n"

    "After forming a matrix, we are now ready to run the Singular Value Decomposition! In order to do so, please study carefully the documentation of the Numpy implementation of the SVD (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.svd.html) and run the SVD for the data matrix you formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in class, the singular values, which are by convention sorted in descending order, give us the importance of the latent concepts (each singular value corresponds to a latent concept in the data). Thus, by inspecting the singular values in our data, we can see whether there is a number of latent concepts/singular values that are overwhelmingly higher than the rest. In those cases, that number of singular values signifies what we call the low rank of the data, i.e., the number of singular values that, if used, can approximate most of the original data adequately, while forcing movies (and users) which behave similarly in the data to be represented by the same latent concept.\n",

    "## Question 3: Inspecting the latent concepts [25%]\n",
    "Now it is time to inspect the \"genres\" / latent concepts. The easiest way to do so is the following: The columns of matrix $U$ correspond to our latent concepts. For each latent concept (say the $j$-th one), we can retrieve the membership of every movie to that concept. This membership vector is the $j$-th column of the $U$ matrix of the SVD. Thus, if we take the $j$-th column of U, the $i$-th value in that vector represents the degree to which the $i$-th movie \"belongs\" to that concept. In order to characterize the concept, we can, thus, take the top-k movies per concept, ranked in descending order by their value in that vector, and visually inspect them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, you should make a function \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def print_concepts(U,num_of_concepts,top_mov):\n",
    "```\n",
    "which takes as input 1) the movie-to-concept matrix $U$, 2) the number of desired concepts, and 3) the number of top movies per concept, and prints the list of top movies per concept (please include title and genre).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in order to avoid negative values, take the absolute value of each entry of the above membership vector. This is a rather ad-hoc but popular choice, however, NMF directly addresses that problem by imposing non-negativity constraints in the model.\n"
